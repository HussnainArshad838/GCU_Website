          <p className='Message'>On behalf of the community of students and staff at Government College University, Lahore, I welcome you warmly to our Webpage. 
          Since its inception in 1864, GCU has been one of the leading educational institutes in South Asia. We have pursued excellence in a wide variety of disciplines. 
          It is no coincidence that our motto “<mark>Courage to Know</mark>” is a call to students and staff members alike to realize their fullest potential and the University’s mission. 
          <br />We are honoured that the spiritual father of our nation, Allama Muhammad Iqbal, is an alumni of GCU Lahore, and proud that two Nobel laureates, Har Gobind Khorana and Abdus Salam, 
          also number amongst our past colleagues. Our students, young and old, have been contributing strongly to the shaping and development of 
          Pakistan’s society and culture.</p>
